## 🛠️ Data Cleaning Instructions  

Before using the dataset in Power BI, the following cleaning steps are required:  

1️⃣ **Convert State Names to Countries**  
   - Replace state names with their respective country names.  
   - Example: Convert "California" to "USA".  

2️⃣ **Adjust Product Sales Units**

   - Standardize numerical formats for revenue.  
   - Convert large numbers (e.g., 5,000,000,000) into **billions (5B)** for better readability.
